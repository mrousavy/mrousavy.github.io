				<p>
					In a team of four, we developed the <b>Drei Friendfinder</b> application for the company

					Firestore as it's backend. <br />
					Over the course of the year we learned many valuable lessons about project management and
					our programming environments. <br />
					I developed the iOS application using <b>Swift</b>/<b>Cocoa Touch</b>, and implemented the
					MVVM design pattern using <b>RxSwift</b> to keep things clean.
