				<p>
					In a team of four, we developed the <b>Drei Friendfinder</b> application for the company
					<i>Hutchison Drei Austria GmbH</i> as our <b>diploma project</b> for the TGM. The
					application included two native mobile applications, Android and iOS, and used Firebase and
					Firestore as it's backend. <br />
					Over the course of the year we learned many valuable lessons about project management and
					our programming environments. <br />
					I developed the iOS application using <b>Swift</b>/<b>Cocoa Touch</b>, and implemented the
					MVVM design pattern using <b>RxSwift</b> to keep things clean.

					I learned to use enterprise tools and understood how to design big applications while
					still keeping an eye on performance, code styling and design.
