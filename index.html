	<p>
In the past few years I have worked for multiple companies, developed numerous open-source projects and helped extending business applications. I've learned to code with Java, found my love for C# and .NET shortly afterwards, started programming for performance-optimization with C++, and began experimenting with iOS and SwiftUI just recently.  <a href="works.html">See some of my work here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I especially enjoy working on projects with either UI/UX-heavy user front-ends, or back-ends like APIs, neural networks or big data applications, but have no problems applying my skills in other areas of expertise. Working in teams has always been a positive experience for me as I am a people-person and like to extend my horizon, as well as bring new ideas and suggestions to the table.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am able to inspire, and get inspired. I love hearing about your cat stories, as well as your understanding of rvalue references in C++. Keeping it stupid-simple, clean and comprehensible has been my motivation for writing clean code and experimenting with graphical user interface design.
