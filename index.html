	<p>
I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.
	</p>
	<p>
Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I’m easily inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. I’m passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I’m never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.
	</p>
	<p>
My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease. I like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the course of my life and career.
	</p>
	<p>
I’m a people-person with deep emotions and empathy, a natural storyteller. I’m able to inspire and am at my best when I’m sharing my creative expressions with others. I currently work remotely and have a full-time commitment at InVision. Outside of my commitments I work with a select freelance client base. Feel free to get in touch by any means of communication.
